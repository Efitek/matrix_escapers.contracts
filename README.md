NFT Staking and Marketplace on the Cardano Blockchain. Powered by Plutus Smart Contracts
A simple contract that allows sales of NFTs and stake them. The seller (owner of an NFT) constructs the contract with parameters unique to the sale and locks the NFT there.
A buyer can then unlock the NFT by submitting a transaction verifying the several requirements defined in the validator.
